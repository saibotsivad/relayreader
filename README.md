# relayreader

Eventual technical paper for the relayreader document.

The basic idea is to have standardization of objects, so that e.g. if
I have a phone number object I can send it to someone and they'll know
how to interpret it.

The current work is attempting to move toward using something like a combination
of [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) and [Schema.org](http://schema.org/).
